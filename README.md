# tic-tac-teo-game
The objective of Tic-Tac-Toe is for a player to place three of their marks (either X or O) in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row on a 3x3 grid.

Game Setup:
The game is played on a 3x3 grid, which consists of nine squares.
Each player chooses a mark: one player selects X and the other O.
Rules:
Starting the Game: Players decide who goes first, often through a coin toss or mutual agreement.
Taking Turns: Players take turns placing their mark (X or O) in an empty square on the grid.
Winning the Game: A player wins by being the first to have three of their marks in a row. This row can be:
Horizontal (e.g., top row: 1, 2, 3)
Vertical (e.g., left column: 1, 4, 7)
Diagonal (e.g., top left to bottom right: 1, 5, 9)
Draw: If all nine squares are filled and neither player has three in a row, the game is a draw.
Example Game:
Turn 1: Player 1 (X) places an X in the center square.
Turn 2: Player 2 (O) places an O in the top left square.
Turn 3: Player 1 (X) places an X in the top center square.
Turn 4: Player 2 (O) places an O in the bottom left square.
Turn 5: Player 1 (X) places an X in the top right square and wins with a horizontal row on the top.
Strategy Tips:
Center First: Controlling the center gives more opportunities to create rows.
Blocking: Always be aware of the opponent's potential to create a row and block it if possible.
Creating Two-Way Wins: Try to create multiple opportunities to win simultaneously, forcing the opponent into a losing position.
